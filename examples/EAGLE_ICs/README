This directory contains initial conditions generated for
the EAGLE suite of simulations. The cosmology, resolution
and phases are the same as used in the original suite. The only
difference is the file format, adapted for SWIFT.

Compared to the original EAGLE runs, the following changes have been
made:

 - The metallicity-dependent density threshold for star formation
   uses the smoothed metallicities and not the raw metallicities
   any more.
 - The redshift of H reionization has been lowered to 7.5 (from 11.5).
 - The Magnesium yields from SNII stars have been boosted by a
   factor of 2.
 - The delay time distribution of the SNIa has been changed to a
   power-law of slope -1 (instead of the exponential model) and
   the rates have been renormalized.

The scripts in this directory download the tables required to
run the EAGLE model. Plotting scripts are also provided
for basic quantities.

VELOCIraptor can be run on the output. The code is compiled
using

cmake -DVR_USE_GAS=ON -DVR_USE_STAR=ON -DV_USE_BH=ON

and run using

stf -C vrconfig_3dfof_subhalos_SO_hydro.cfg -i eagle_0035 -o halos_0035 -I 2
