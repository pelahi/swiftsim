An example planetary simulation of the first 10 hours of a grazing giant impact 
onto the proto-Earth (a roughly canonical Moon-forming impact) with the simple 
Tillotson equation of state and 10^5 SPH particles.

See Kegerreis et al. (2019), Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 487:4 for more about 
using SWIFT for planetary simulations.

More examples and planetary-specific documentation coming soon!

This example requires the code to be configured to use the planetary
hydrodynamics scheme and equations of state:
 --with-hydro=planetary --with-equation-of-state=planetary
