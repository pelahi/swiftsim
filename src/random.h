   * (MWC) method, this method depends on the type of random number and

   * the different types of random numbers.

   * even more.
   * 3. We calculate a prime multiplication for the id with a quadratic
   * term.
   * 4. We calculate the seed by using a Quadratic congruential generator,
   * in which we use the id part and the current time step bin.
